Hi there! I'm Louay Saafi 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Louay, a Full Stack Developer from Tunisia with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Python, MERN stack, and Java Spring Boot. I’m a recent Coding Dojo graduate with a deep passion for building impactful web applications and a dedication to continuous learning and exploration in the tech industry.

🚀 About Me
I'm a tech enthusiast and problem solver, currently diving into web and mobile development with a focus on creating seamless user experiences. My background spans various projects, from building a hotel management system with features like WebSocket-powered messaging and data visualization to creating a real estate platform in Flask. My journey has given me hands-on experience with a range of technologies, including React, Angular, Flask, Django, and SCSS.

Lately, I've been focused on building front-end features for an Angular-based medical appointment booking system. This project has challenged me to integrate various UI libraries like Angular Material and PrimeNG to deliver a cohesive and responsive user interface. I’m also working on incorporating digital prescriptions with real-time data and QR code generation, striving to make healthcare solutions more accessible and user-friendly.

🌱 What I’m Learning
Mobile Development: As a beginner in this field, I’m exploring frameworks and tools to eventually expand my development skills across mobile platforms.
UI/UX Design in Angular: Creating intuitive, responsive designs is a priority, especially for projects involving healthcare and real estate.
Data Visualization: Using Chart.js to create dynamic visuals and bring data to life in applications, providing users with meaningful insights.

💼 Professional Experience
I’ve had the opportunity to work in both startup environments and collaborative team settings. Recently, I completed an internship at Hippomed, where I was tasked with building essential front-end components for a healthcare booking system. This experience has honed my ability to tackle complex problems, adapt quickly, and deliver polished, functional code.

🌍 Goals and Aspirations
I am highly motivated to grow my expertise in web development, pursue potential roles in IoT and RFID projects, and explore full-time or freelance opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully to innovative projects. In the future, I aim to expand my skill set to include mobile development and cloud technologies. I’m also eager to obtain a digital nomad visa for Estonia and explore study opportunities in computer science in Belgium.
